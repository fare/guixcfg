Determine why guix 1.4.0 segfaults so much:
I tried to install Guix under NixOS so they can share the same encrypted lvm hard-disk.
This required a lot of editing guix-install.sh to disable tests and replace mv by rsync
to fix broken steps. But in the end, guix segfaults while loading srfi/srfi-9 from guile
(after loading it, before it recursively loads system/base/ck, says strace, comparing to
what happens on another machine where things work). All the guile libraries are from
guile 3.0.8, but I notice the guix 1.4.0 binary tarball also contains guile 3.0.7.
Maybe the segfault is due to guix having somehow been compiled with 3.0.7 but being run
against 3.0.8 which happens to be slightly incompatible?

While tweaking things, I got as far as the build to instead segfault while building
shepherd-guix-daemon, though I'm not sure how to invoke things to determine where the
segfault happens.

My friend Attila tells me that guix gc might also have corrupted my installation with
respect to extension channels I use in addition to guix strictly speaking. Could that
be the case? Is it a known bug? Are there known fixes or workarounds?
